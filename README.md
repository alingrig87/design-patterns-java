# Design Patterns

Design patterns represent elegant solutions to recurring problems in software design, offering a systematic approach to creating reusable and maintainable software. They play a crucial role in facilitating a faster learning curve for new frameworks.

## Types of Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
Creational patterns provide various ways to create objects, allowing developers flexibility in object instantiation.

###### - [Singleton Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/creational/singleton/README.md)
###### - [Factory Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/creational/factory/README.md)
###### - [Abstract Factory Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/creational/abstractFactory/README.md)
###### - [Prototype Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/creational/prototype/README.md)
###### - [Object Pool Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/creational/objectPool/README.md)

### Structural Patterns
Structural patterns focus on defining the relationships between objects, enabling a clear understanding of how they work together.
###### - [Composite Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/structural/composite/README.md)
###### - [Adapter Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/structural/adapter/README.md)
###### - [Decorator Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/structural/decorator/README.md)
###### - [Facade Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/structural/decorator/README.md)
###### - [Bridge Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/structural/bridge/README.md)

### Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns address the interaction and communication between objects, promoting effective collaboration within the software system.

###### - [Memento Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/behavioral/memento/README.md)
###### - [State Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/behavioral/state/README.md)
###### - [Iterator Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/behavioral/iterator/README.md)
###### - [Strategy Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/behavioral/strategy/README.md)
###### - [Command Pattern](src/main/java/com/design/patterns/behavioral/command/README.md)
