# Prototype Pattern

## Description
Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that focuses on creating new objects by cloning an existing object, known as the prototype. The goal of this pattern is to avoid the often high cost of creating new objects through a constructor by instead concentrating on duplicating existing objects.

## Components
1. **Prototype (Interface or Base Prototype Class):** Declares the cloning method, which is implemented by concrete classes.

2. **Concrete Prototype (Concrete Prototype Class):** Implements the cloning method to produce a copy of its own instance.

3. **Client:** Requests copies of prototypes through the cloning method, without knowing the concrete classes involved.

## Features and Advantages
- Provides a way to create complex objects without using a constructor.
- Reduces the cost of creating new objects, especially when object initialization is costly.
- Allows dynamic addition and removal of prototypes at runtime.
- Clients can create new objects using existing prototypes without knowing the details of concrete implementations.

## Notes
- Prototype Pattern is often used in scenarios where a system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented, and the system is configured with multiple

## Examples of Prototype Pattern Usage

1. **Document Cloning:**
    - In a document processing system, the Prototype Pattern can be used to clone document objects with specific formatting, allowing users to create new documents based on existing ones.

2. **Graphic Design Tool:**
    - In a graphic design application, the Prototype Pattern can be employed to clone graphic elements, such as shapes or icons, to create variations with different styles or properties.

3. **Configuration Settings:**
    - Consider a system with various configuration settings. The Prototype Pattern can be applied to clone configuration objects, providing a way to create new configurations based on existing ones.
