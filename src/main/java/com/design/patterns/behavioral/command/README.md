# Command Pattern

## Description
The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a standalone object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and support for undoable operations. It encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the parameters.

## Components
1. **Command:**
    - This is an interface or an abstract class that declares an `execute` method. Concrete command classes implement this interface, encapsulating a specific action.

2. **ConcreteCommand:**
    - These are the concrete classes that implement the Command interface. They encapsulate a specific action and hold a reference to the object that will perform the action.

3. **Invoker:**
    - This is a class that asks the command to execute the request. It does not know the specific details of the command but only holds a reference to the command object.

4. **Receiver:**
    - This is the class that performs the actual action associated with a request.

5. **Client:**
    - This initiates requests by creating and configuring command objects. It is responsible for deciding which command to execute.

## Features and Advantages
- Decouples the sender and receiver of a request, providing flexibility and extensibility.
- Allows parameterization of objects with different requests.
- Supports undoable operations through the use of command objects.
- Enables queuing of requests and logging of commands.

## Benefits of Command Pattern

1. **Decoupling of Components:**
    - The sender and receiver are decoupled, promoting flexibility in the system's design.

2. **Support for Undo/Redo:**
    - Commands can be designed to support undo operations, allowing for the reversal of previously executed commands.

3. **Parameterization and Queuing:**
    - Objects can be parameterized with different commands, and commands can be queued for execution.

4. **Logging and Auditing:**
    - Commands provide a natural point for logging and auditing operations.

## Examples of Command Pattern Usage

1. **Remote Control with Buttons:**
    - A remote control can be implemented using the Command Pattern, where each button corresponds to a specific command.

2. **Text Editor Commands:**
    - In a text editor, commands like Cut, Copy, and Paste can be implemented using the Command Pattern.
