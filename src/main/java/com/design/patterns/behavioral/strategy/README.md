# Strategy Pattern

## Description
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the client to choose an algorithm at runtime, independently of the context. This pattern promotes flexibility by enabling the definition of a set of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable.

## Components
1. **Context:**
    - This is the class that maintains a reference to the strategy object and may define an interface that is common to all supported algorithms.

2. **Strategy:**
    - This is an interface or an abstract class that declares a method or a set of methods that concrete strategies must implement.

3. **ConcreteStrategy:**
    - These are the concrete classes implementing the Strategy interface. They provide specific implementations for the algorithms defined by the strategy.

## Features and Advantages
- Promotes flexibility by allowing clients to choose from a family of algorithms at runtime.
- Enables easy addition of new algorithms without modifying existing code.
- Encapsulates algorithms, making them interchangeable and independent of clients.

## Benefits of Strategy Pattern

1. **Flexibility and Extensibility:**
    - Easily add new algorithms without modifying existing code. The context can switch between strategies dynamically.

2. **Encapsulation of Algorithms:**
    - Algorithms are encapsulated within concrete strategy classes, promoting code organization and maintenance.

3. **Improved Testability:**
    - Each strategy can be tested independently, enhancing the overall testability of the system.

4. **Reduced Conditional Statements:**
    - Eliminates conditional statements in the client code by delegating the algorithm selection to the context.

## Examples of Strategy Pattern Usage

1. **Sorting Algorithms:**
    - A sorting algorithm strategy interface can have concrete implementations like BubbleSort, QuickSort, and MergeSort.

2. **Payment Processing:**
    - In a payment processing system, different payment strategies (CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment) can be implemented using the Strategy Pattern.
