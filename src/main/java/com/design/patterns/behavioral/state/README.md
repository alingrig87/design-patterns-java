# State Pattern

## Description
The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where an object needs to change its behavior dynamically based on its internal state.

## Components
1. **Context:**
    - This is the class that maintains a reference to the current state object. It delegates the state-specific behavior to the current state.

2. **State:**
    - This is an interface or an abstract class that defines a set of methods that encapsulate the behavior associated with a particular state.

3. **Concrete States:**
    - These are the classes that implement the State interface. Each concrete state provides its own implementation of the behavior associated with a specific state.

## Features and Advantages
- Allows an object to alter its behavior dynamically when its internal state changes.
- Encapsulates the state-specific behavior in separate classes, promoting a clean and modular design.
- Simplifies code by eliminating large switch-case statements that depend on the object's state.

## Notes
- State Pattern is especially useful when an object's behavior is determined by its state, and this behavior needs to change dynamically at runtime.

## Benefits of State Pattern

1. **Encapsulation of State-specific Behavior:**
    - State Pattern encapsulates the behavior associated with each state in separate classes, promoting code organization and maintainability.

2. **Flexibility in Behavior Modification:**
    - Allows the context object to switch between different states, thereby modifying its behavior dynamically.

3. **Elimination of Large Switch-case Statements:**
    - Replaces complex switch-case statements that depend on the object's state with a cleaner and more modular structure.

## Examples of State Pattern Usage

1. **Traffic Light Control System:**
    - In a traffic light control system, the state pattern can be applied to represent different states (e.g., Red, Yellow, Green) and define the behavior associated with each state.

2. **Order Processing System:**
    - An order processing system may use the state pattern to represent various order states (e.g., Pending, Shipped, Delivered) and define the specific actions and transitions for each state.

3. **Vending Machine:**
    - The state pattern can be employed in a vending machine to model different states (e.g., Ready, Dispensing, Out of Stock) and define the appropriate behavior for each state.
