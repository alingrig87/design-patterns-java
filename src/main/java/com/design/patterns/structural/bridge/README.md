# Bridge Pattern

## Description
The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to evolve independently. Instead of permanently binding an interface to a specific implementation, this pattern introduces a bridge structure that enables their independent extension and modification.

## Components
1. **Abstraction:**
    - This is the abstract class or interface that defines a general interface for services. It may contain a reference to an implementation and can delegate operations to the implementation.

2. **Implementor:**
    - This is an interface or abstract class that defines the methods that the abstraction will call. Implementors provide concrete implementations of these methods.

3. **Refined Abstraction:**
    - This is an extension of the abstraction class or interface, adding specific details or modifying behavior based on needs.

4. **Concrete Implementor:**
    - This is a class that truly implements the Implementor interface. There is a correspondence between the implementor and concrete implementor.

## Features and Advantages
- Allows the separation of abstraction and implementation, enabling them to evolve independently.
- Redefining implementation details does not affect client code.
- Supports composition over hierarchy, making the system more flexible.

## Notes
- The Bridge Pattern is effective when there is a need for independent extension and modification of both abstraction and implementation.

## Benefits of the Bridge Pattern

1. **Development Independence:**
    - Abstraction and implementation can be developed independently, facilitating the system's extension.

2. **Avoidance of Deep Hierarchies:**
    - Replaces a deep class hierarchy with two separate hierarchies, making the system more modular and manageable.

3. **Flexibility in Implementation:**
    - Allows modification and extension of implementation details without affecting client code.

4. **Better Object Composition:**
    - Supports object composition to achieve complex behaviors.

## Examples of Bridge Pattern Usage

1. **Display Devices:**
    - An abstraction can represent a display device, and the implementation can include various types of displays.

2. **Route Services:**
    - A navigation system can use the Bridge Pattern to separate route calculation logic from the visual interface.
