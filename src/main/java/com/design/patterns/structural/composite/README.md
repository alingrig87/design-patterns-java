# Composite Pattern

## Description
The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with hierarchical structures where clients need to work with both individual elements and compositions.

## Components
1. **Component:**
    - This is an interface or an abstract class that declares the common interface for all concrete classes (leaf and composite). It defines operations that are common to both individual objects and compositions.

2. **Leaf:**
    - These are the individual objects that implement the Component interface. They are the building blocks and do not have child components.

3. **Composite:**
    - These are the objects that also implement the Component interface but can have child components. Composites can contain both leaves and other composites.

4. **Client:**
    - This is the class that uses the Component interface to work with objects in the composition. The client treats both leaves and composites uniformly.

## Features and Advantages
- Enables clients to work with individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- Simplifies the client code as it doesn't need to distinguish between leaf and composite objects.
- Facilitates the construction of complex tree structures using a recursive approach.
- Allows the addition or removal of components at runtime.

## Notes
- The Composite Pattern is beneficial when dealing with part-whole hierarchies and when clients should be able to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

## Benefits of Composite Pattern

1. **Uniform Treatment of Objects:**
    - Clients can interact with individual objects and compositions in a consistent manner.

2. **Flexibility in Structure:**
    - The structure of the composite can be easily extended by adding new components, whether leaves or composites.

3. **Simplified Client Code:**
    - Client code becomes simpler as it doesn't need to differentiate between individual objects and compositions.

4. **Dynamic Composition:**
    - Components can be added or removed at runtime, allowing for dynamic tree structure modifications.

## Examples of Composite Pattern Usage

1. **Graphics Hierarchy:**
    - In a graphics system, shapes (leaves) and groups of shapes (composites) can be represented using the Composite Pattern.

2. **File System Structure:**
    - A file system hierarchy can be modeled using the Composite Pattern, where files and directories are represented as leaves and composites, respectively.
